            <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Zachary and this is my first attempt at creating a website on my own
                in any capacity.
                It's also my first time handling code in earnest to create something interesting!
            </p>

            <p> I hope to switch from a career in psychiatric healthcare into computer science. I love playing video
                games on my computers or upgrading its parts. Due to that fondness I've interacted with technology and
                especially computers for the majority of my life.
            </p>

            <p>The transition from psychiatry into computer science will be interesting. I hope you'll hang around and
                watch me thorughout this journey while I learn what I can do during my Full Stack Bootcamp.
